Email AI Agent: Detailed Project Write-Up
Overview
The Email AI Agent is a smart assistant designed to streamline email management by automatically reading incoming emails, generating concise summaries, and drafting professional replies. Built with Python, this project leverages OpenAI’s GPT-4 model for natural language processing and uses the Gmail API for interacting with your email account. A user-friendly interface is provided via Streamlit, allowing you to review, edit, and approve AI-generated content before sending responses.

Key Features
Gmail Integration via OAuth 2.0:
Securely authenticate with Gmail to fetch unread emails, read their content, send replies, and update email status—all without storing your credentials insecurely.

AI-Powered Summarization and Reply Generation:
Utilize OpenAI’s GPT-4 to generate brief and insightful summaries of email content and draft professional replies. The AI takes into account the email’s context (subject, sender, body) to produce relevant and clear responses.

Interactive Streamlit UI:
An easy-to-use dashboard where you can view email details, AI-generated summaries, and proposed replies. You have the option to approve, edit, or skip the suggested response.

Modular Architecture:
The code is organized into distinct modules:

gmail_utils.py: Handles Gmail API interactions, including OAuth 2.0 authentication, reading emails, sending replies, and marking emails as read.

openai_utils.py: Manages communication with OpenAI’s API for summarization and reply generation.

streamlit_app.py: The main application that ties together the Gmail and AI functionalities into an interactive web-based interface.

Best Practices for Development and Deployment:
The project excludes the virtual environment from version control using a .gitignore file and includes a requirements.txt file to facilitate easy dependency installation. Sensitive information such as API keys is managed through environment variables.

System Architecture
Email Fetching:

The Gmail API is used to retrieve unread emails.

OAuth 2.0 authentication ensures secure access to your Gmail account.

AI Processing:

Each email’s subject, sender, and body are sent to OpenAI’s GPT-4.

Two API calls are made: the first to generate a summary and the second to generate a draft reply.

The conversation history (context) is maintained for coherence between summarization and reply generation.

User Interaction:

The Streamlit interface displays the original email content, the AI-generated summary, and the proposed reply.

Users can approve the reply (which triggers sending via the Gmail API), edit it, or skip the email.

Deployment and Version Control:

The project is managed using Git and hosted on GitHub.

Virtual environments are excluded from the repository, ensuring that only source code and essential configuration files (like requirements.txt and README.md) are tracked.
